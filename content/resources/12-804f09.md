description: Animated tropopause maps at 12 hour intervals during the Blizzard of
  2003, a typical "northeaster" with record breaking snowfall for Boston. Tropopause
  maps such as these are an analysis of potential temperature (color contours) on
  a surface of constant potential vorticity, Q (Q = 2.0 PVU). This analysis contains
  the essential information needed to understand the dynamics of weather systems within
  the troposphere. "Cold" tropopause (i.e. low potential temperature) regions are
  associated with cyclonic circulations, while "warm" tropopause regions are associated
  with anti-cyclonic circulations. (Image by Dr. Lodovica Illari.)
