  caption: Animated tropopause maps at 12 hour intervals during the Blizzard of 2003,
    a typical "northeaster" with record breaking snowfall for Boston. Tropopause maps
    such as these are an analysis of potential temperature (color contours) on a surface
    of constant potential vorticity, Q (Q = 2.0 PVU). This analysis contains the essential
    information needed to understand the dynamics of weather systems within the troposphere.
    "Cold" tropopause (i.e. low potential temperature) regions are associated with
    cyclonic circulations, while "warm" tropopause regions are associated with anti-cyclonic
    circulations. (Image by Dr. Lodovica Illari.)
